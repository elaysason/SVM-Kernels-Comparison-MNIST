## General
The algorithms learn per network a training set of MISIT,the hand written digit database.It makes predictions of new set of digit (test set).

The MINSIT databse got digits from 0 to 9

The various classifiers try to learn the the different characteristics unique to each digit, thus matching the digits in the test set to the digit that best suits it.
