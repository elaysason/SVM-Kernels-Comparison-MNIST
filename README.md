## General
The algorithms learn per algorithm a training set of MISIT,the hand written digit database.It makes predictions of new set of digit (test set).

The MINSIT databse got digits from 0 to 9

The various classifiers try to learn the the different characteristics unique to each digit, thus matching the digits in the test set to the digit that best suits it.

### Background
SVM is a suprvised learning model that is used for classifiction and regression analsis. In order to so it creates a hyperlane or multipule ones and classifiction is detrimned by being below or above the hyperlane and can be using kerenels in order to change the hyperlane created.
